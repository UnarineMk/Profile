                    <li>Love: The first thing I would like you to know is, God is Love, God loves us all equally and
                        God's
                        Love Never Changes, God's Love is always the same yesterday, today and forever. Hence he's
                        the
                        same
                        yesterday, today and forever. So I would like us to all show love as well to other people no
                        matter
                        what they've done to you just show love. Remember when you talk about love we not talking
                        about
                        the
                        worldly love but we talking about Godly love. God's love is genuine, the love that never
                        fails,
                        his
                        love is unconditional. Never Give Up on Love, Never Ever Give Up on Love. Love those who
                        hate
                        you,
                        love those who hurt you, love those who gossip about you, love those you don't even know,

                        show
                        his
                        love to people, God wants you to love so much because he knows that with love you destroy
                        fear,
                        with
                        love you destroy anger, with love you destroy disappointment, with the love you destroy
                        stress
                        and
                        with the love you chasing demons. And I would lastly like to say that genuinely love God and
