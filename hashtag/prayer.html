                    Love Never Changes, God's Love is always the same yesterday, today and forever. Hence he's the same
                    yesterday, today and forever. So I would like us to all show love as well to other people no matter
                    what they've done to you just show love. Remember when you talk about love we not talking about the
                    worldly love but we talking about Godly love. God's love is genuine, the love that never fails, his
                    love is unconditional. Never Give Up on Love, Never Ever Give Up on Love. Love those who hate you,
                    love those who hurt you, love those who gossip about you, love those you don't even know, love those
                    you met, just show love to everyone show love that's all that God wants, God wants you to show his
                    love to people, God wants you to love so much because he knows that with love you destroy fear, with
                    love you destroy anger, with love you destroy disappointment, with the love you destroy stress and
                    with the love you chasing demons. And I would lastly like to say that genuinely love God and love
                    his word genuinely.</li>

                <li> <b>Prayer:</b>  repent for showing hatred towards people.</li>
                <li><b>Prayer:</b>  repent for unforgiveness, you can't love someone if you haven't forgiven them for whatever wrong they've done to you</li>
                <li><b>Prayer:</b> I ask God to show you what real love looks like, ask him to show you what real love feels like</li>
