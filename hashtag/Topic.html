                    Love
                </h1>
            </div>
            <div id="topic1">
                <ul>
                    <li>Love is all-consuming, empowering, and lives in each of us. Our heart is the symbol of the love
                        that resides in us and God is the symbol of the love that reflects down on Earth.

                        When we think about the Bible, we think of it as being a testament to Jesus and all of the love
                        he has given to His people.

                        The Bible is one giant love story to God and his journey towards our acceptance and forgiveness
                        of self and others.</li>
                    <li>"Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death,
                        its jealousy unyielding as the grave. It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame. Many
                        waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If one were to give all the wealth of
                        one’s house for love, it would be utterly scorned." ~ <b>Song of Solomon 8:6</b></li>
                    <li> "Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them
                        falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up.
                        Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? Though one
                        may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken." ~
                        <b>Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</b>
                    </li>
                    <li> “But at the beginning of creation God ‘made them male and female.’ ‘For this reason a man will
                        leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.’So
                        they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one
                        separate.” ~ <b>Mark 10:9-6</b></li>

                </ul>

                    Faith
                </h1>
            </div>
            <div id="topic1">
                <ul>
                    <li>"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" Hebrews 11: 1
                        Faith is the connecting power into the spiritual realm, which links us with God and makes Him
                        become a tangible reality to the sense perceptions of a person. Faith is the basic ingredient to
                        begin a relationship with God.
                        Faith is the assurance that the things revealed and promised in the Word are true, even though
                        unseen, and gives the believer a conviction that what he expects in faith, will come to pass.
                        Faith is the tangible essence of what is hoped for - so tangible that the faith itself, is the
                        evidence/reality of those things that are not yet visible. In other words,
                        it becomes so tangible that you now possess it. It becomes a reality in the spiritual realm.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is impossible to be saved without faith and "without faith it is impossible to please God"
                        <b> Hebrews 11: 6</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Romans 4: 3 "to him who ..
                        .. believes on Him who justifies the ungodly,
                        his faith is accounted for righteousness" <b>Romans 4:</b> </li>
                    <li>"To those who have obtained like precious faith by the righteousness of our God and Saviour,
                        Jesus Christ ." <b>2 Pet. 1: 1</b></li>

                    <li> "God is the author and finisher of our faith" Hebrews 12: 2</li>

                    Fearing the Lord
                </h1>
            </div>
            <div id="topic1">
                <ul>
                    <li>The fear of the Lord, the gift of the Holy Spirit, doesn’t mean being afraid of God, since we
                        know that God is our Father that always loves and forgives us,it is no servile fear, but
                        rather a joyful awareness of God’s grandeur and a grateful realization that only in him do our
                        hearts find true peace.</li>
                    <li>Scripture is full of examples of how fearing God is a positive rather than a negative thing. For
                        example in Genesis 42:18, Joseph wins his brothers' trust when he declares he is a God-fearing
                        man. It was because the midwives feared God that they obeyed him instead of the authorities by
                        sparing the Hebrew babies
                        <b>(Exodus 1:17)</b>. Pharaoh brought disaster on his nation because he did not fear God
                        <b>(Exodus 9:29-31)</b>. Moses chose leaders to help him on the basis that they feared God and
                        wouldn't take bribes
                        <b>(Exodus 18:21)</b> and told the Hebrews that God met with them in a terrifying display of his
                        power so that they wouldn't sin
                        <b>(Exodus 20:20)</b>. The Mosaic Law cites fear of God as a reason to treat the disabled and
                        elderly well
                        <b>(Leviticus 19:14, 32)</b>. And lest you think this is only an Old Testament idea, note that
                        Jesus states this stronger than anyone when he says, "Don't be afraid of those who want to kill
                        your body; they cannot touch your soul. Fear only God, who can destroy both soul and body in
                        hell" (Matthew 10:28). And Paul says to work toward complete holiness because we fear God (2
                        Corinthians 7:1)
                    </li>
